/*
  The CPR road layer as geometry: the quads and wall panels a `.TRK` describes.

  `parseCprTrk` returns the records; this lays them out, once, for whatever draws the track and
  whatever drives on it, so the two cannot disagree. It follows JSTrackViewer's road layer
  (docs/LEVELS.md, "CPR's road layer"):

    - Each record owns the stretch to the next one; a closed circuit's last record runs back
      to record 0 (`cprSegmentPairs`).
    - Only the slots between the outermost walls are there (`cprVisibleSlots`), and a slot
      collapsed to no width on both records is skipped (`isDegenerateSlot`).
    - A slot's texture is the packed reference of the record that owns the stretch, its U the
      record's own u1..u4 (road tiles carry their edge line on one side, so U is never tiled
      across the width) and its V runs along the stretch, one tile every 128 ft.
    - A wall stands on a cross section point of the owning record and spans to the next
      record's same point, stacked by its type (`CPR_WALL_LAYERS`). Each panel of the stack
      is one of the four strips of a wall texture, or the catch fence.

  Positions are the file's own: `[x, altitude, along]` in feet. The file says nothing of which
  way `along` runs against the terrain's rows; the caller places it.
