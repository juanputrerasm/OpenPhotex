  The tables are transcribed from the string tables in CPREDIT.EXE (the "Demented(R) Track
  Editor(TM)") and cross-checked against DATA\LAGUNA.TRK extracted from LAGUNA.POD. Ported from

  How a wall of each type is stacked.

  The guide says "On walls higher than short wall you can change which part of the wall you

  point. Which of those four are actually authored is measurable: for a given wall type, a
  part that is meaningful varies from wall to wall, and a part that is leftover collapses
  onto a single default value (4103 at Laguna). Counting distinct values per part across
  LAGUNA.TRK gives:

    type 1 Short wall                     part 0 authored, 1..3 collapse   -> 1 part
    type 3 Short wall with catch fencing  part 0 authored, 1..3 collapse   -> 1 part + fence

    type 5 Wall-catch-wall                parts 0,1 authored, 2,3 leftover -> wall, fence, wall

  which is self-consistent with the editor's own names, and the "Wall-catch-wall" name pins
  down where the fence sits in type 5.

  The catch fencing itself is never one of those four textures. CPREDIT.EXE references
  art\catch3d.raw and art\catch.raw directly, both ship in STARTUP.POD, and neither ever
  appears in a .TTX. The fence is implied by the wall type (see CPR_CATCH_FENCE_NAMES).
