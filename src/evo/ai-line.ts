/*
  4x4 Evolution's AI lines, and what they say about the course.

  A track can carry recorded laps for the computer drivers, AI\CLASSc\AI_cnTRACK.TXT: one
  per driver line n (1 to 3) for each truck class c, often the same three laps copied into
  all three classes. Each is a text header followed by the lap as a list of samples:

    File Version:     12
    Driver Name:      Antigoon
    Lap Time:         01m48s07ms
    Class:            Class_3
    ...
    Checkpoint Count: 9
    Point Count:      1411
    3197.96, 167.77, 4351.55     position, x / height / z like the .SIT
    139.59                       speed
    8                            the checkpoint the driver is heading for

  These are the lines the trucks drive, so they are the track's other courses, and they
  settle something the .SIT course cannot say on its own: which of its runs make up a lap.
  TERRAMAR's course lists its 23 lap runs and then two more on the parallel road beside the
  start, which no driver goes near; joined in file order they drew a detour back and forth
  across the start. See lapRuns.

  Ported from JSTrackViewer's src/worker/evo/evo-ai-lines.js, the only implementation.
