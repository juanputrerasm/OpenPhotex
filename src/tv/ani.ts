/*
  .ANI animated texture definitions (Terminal Velocity / Fury3 / F!Zone).

  Referenced from LVL header line 8. Plain ASCII, CRLF, count-prefixed. Each animation names
  the texture slot it replaces, then its frame count and rate, then the frames:

    <animationCount>
      <base texture name>
      <frameCount>,<rate>
      <frame 1 name>
      ...
      <frame N name>

  From FURY3.POD's AMINE-T1.ANI:

    4
    FAN1.RAW
    4,16384
    FAN1.RAW  FAN2.RAW  FAN3.RAW  FAN4.RAW
    FS1.RAW
    4,16384
    ...

  Measured across the three archives: 169 files, 123 animations. The rate is the usual 16.16
  fixed point, so 16384 is a quarter unit per frame. Read as frames per second that gives 0.25,
  which is far too slow for a spinning fan, and as seconds per frame it gives four seconds.
  The engine's own tick rate is not recorded in the level data, so the viewer treats the value
  as a relative rate against a fixed base (see ANIMATION_BASE_FPS) rather than claiming a unit
  it cannot verify.

  The base frame is always the first frame in shipped content, so a viewer that ignores .ANI
  entirely still shows a valid still image. This is polish, not missing content.

  Ported from JSTrackViewer's src/worker/ani-parser.js, the only implementation.

/*
  Frames per second at rate 16384.

  Chosen to read correctly rather than derived from the file: fans and light strobes at this
  speed look like the game. Scaled linearly by the animation's own rate so the relative speeds
  the author set are preserved.
