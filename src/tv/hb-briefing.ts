/*
  The mission briefing (Hellbender).

  LVL header line 1 is `null.txt` in every Terminal Velocity and Fury3 level, and
  `<stem>.txt` in every Hellbender one. The file is the pre-mission briefing screen:

    globe.bin                     <- the globe model that screen spins
    roidg1.raw                    <- the texture on it
    PLANET: Snow City
    MISSION: Freedom
    <briefing text, one line per displayed line>
    .                             <- terminator

  Verified against all nine shipped .TXT files. The label on lines 2 and 3 is not fixed -
  PLANET, AREA, LOCATION and OBJECTIVE all occur - so both are kept as the authored
  "<label>: <value>" pair rather than being forced into a planet/mission shape the data does
  not always have.

  Only those two lines are read. The briefing prose below them is the game's own pre-mission
  screen copy, hard-wrapped for that screen; it is a page of text, not a property of the map,
  and the viewer has nowhere it belongs. The two labelled lines do belong, because they are
  what a Hellbender level has instead of the track name and locale every other game writes.

  One file serves a whole world, so the two or three levels of a world share a briefing.

  Ported from JSTrackViewer's src/worker/hb-briefing.js, the only implementation.
