/*
  .NAV navigation points (Hellbender).

  Referenced from LVL header line 13, the same slot Terminal Velocity and Fury3 use, but the
  record is not theirs. Hellbender interleaves four named sections the TV form has no place
  for - a priority/time pair, a completion sound and its briefing line, a proximity sound -
  and terminates every entry with a rule of dashes:

    <entryCount>
      <type>
      <x>,<y>,<z>
      !priority,time
      <priority>,<time>
      @Completion sound & completion text (39 chars max)
      <completion .wav, or null>
      null: line ignored
      ; Proximity Sound file
      <proximity .wav, or null>
      <objective text>
      <type-specific payload>
      -------------------------------------------------

  Parsing that with the TV reader yields one bogus point and stops, which is why the viewer
  used to leave Hellbender's .NAV unread. The grammar above is verified against all 26 .NAV
  files shipped in Hellbender's GAME.POD: 441 entries, every file consumed exactly to EOF
  with nothing left over, and every placement index in a target list, boss, escort or
  retrieve payload resolving into that level's .DEF placement list - 786 indices, no misses.

  Coordinates are the .DEF's 16.16 fixed point world units, not the TV scale; see
  tv-coords.js for the measurement that settles it.

  Ported from JSTrackViewer's src/worker/hb-nav-parser.js, the only implementation.

  Type names.

  Types 0 to 6 are the TV/F3 seven in the same order and with the same payloads, so they keep
  those names. The six above them are Hellbender's own and no editor for this game survives
  to name them, so each is named from what the shipped levels do with it and nothing more is
  claimed:

    7   position is always (0, level height, 0) and the text is always "Sync Point" or
        "Sync point: auto added". 69 entries, no payload. It separates the objectives that
        can be done in any order from the ones that come after them.
    8   two entries, both "Locate the prison and drop a Rescue Beacon".
    9   the last entry of all 26 files, text "End of Navs", no payload. A terminator.
    12  three entries, all "Escort ... to the Jump Zone". One placement index.
    13  one entry, "Retrieve the Message Pod". One placement index.
    14  one entry, "It's Nyx again! ... take him down". One placement index, and the only
        one of the three that carries a real map position.

  The three types whose stored position is not a map position.

  An escort or retrieve objective follows an object that moves, so the file has no fixed

  x = -2105071345 and z = 2, which is not a point on any 128-cell map. The placement index in
  the payload is the real answer, and the loader resolves the marker onto that object instead.

  Type 14 is listed here as an escort-style objective but ROID4's single entry does carry a
  usable position, so its own coordinates are kept when they are in range.
