/*
  TV-family world coordinates.

  Terminal Velocity, Fury3 and F!Zone store every map position the same way, in .DEF object
  placements, .NAV navigation points, .PUP powerup drops and .TDF tunnel mouths alike:

    X, Z  horizontal, 2^20 units per terrain cell, signed, wrapping on the 256-cell map
    Y     height, 2^15 units per altitude step (the 0..255 range of the .RAW heightfield)

  Both scales are measured, not assumed. Sampling FURY3.POD's ATMOS level at
  ((x >> 20) % 256, (z >> 20) % 256) gives a terrain height that equals (y >> 15) exactly, for
  every placement in the file, and each .NAV target list's position matches the placement of
  the enemy it names to the unit.

  That second fact is why the definition Y offset matters (see def-loader.js): placements are
  authored flush with the ground, so nothing in a placement record can lift an object.

  Ported from JSTrackViewer's src/worker/tv-coords.js, the only implementation.

  Hellbender's placement scale.

  Hellbender reuses the TV/F3 side files - .NAV, .PUP and .TDF sit at the same .LVL header
  lines and carry the same records - but not their units. Its .DEF placements are 16.16 fixed
  point world units with 8 world units per terrain cell (see def-loader.js), and the side
  files share that space rather than the 2^20-per-cell one.

  Measured, not assumed. Every type-0 .NAV entry names the .DEF placements that make up one
  objective, so the entry's own position should land on the objects it names. Across the 179
  target lists in the 26 shipped Hellbender levels, read at this scale the entry sits a
  median of 0.00 cells and a mean of 0.30 cells from the nearest placement it names, inside
  4 cells in 178 of 179 cases. Read at the TV scale the same figures are a median of 23.26
  cells and 3 of 179.

  Heights are the .DEF's own reading: world units are 16.16 fixed point and one heightfield
  step is half a world unit. Unlike the TV form this is NOT clamped at zero, because
  Hellbender authors its underground sections at negative altitudes and a caller has to be
  able to tell those apart from ground level.
