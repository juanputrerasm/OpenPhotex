/*
  Engine, gearbox and drive force (MTM2_PHYSICS.md §5.2; MONSTER_EXE_ANALYSIS.md §8.4, §8.5).

  - The engine rpm is updated inside each tire's longitudinal step, so it chases four targets
    per step, one per tire in FR, FL, RR, RL order. On the ground the target comes from that
    tire's forward speed (at least 800 rpm); in the air from the wheel's spin, at least
    throttle × limit, wound down by the brake.
  - Torque follows the curve, times the throttle, times 1.1 for computer trucks on Professional
    on a Sonic track or 0.9 for a human driver with automatic shifting.
  - The gearbox shifts instantly: automatically between first and third gear at 7000 and 3500
    rpm, or on request with manual shifting.
