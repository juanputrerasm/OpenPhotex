/*
  The MTM2 water level (MTM2_PHYSICS.md §2.4).

  - The level's `!waterHeight` is in half feet: the game keeps it as `value << 7` in its height
    units of 1/256 ft (terrain heights are the RAW byte << 9). 0 means the level has no water,
    and the level then stays at 0 ft.
  - During a race the surface bobs: level = base + sin(phase) × 0.25 ft, the phase turning once
    every 8 s. In Snow it stays at the base (the water is frozen).
  - The game advances the phase by dt / 8 each frame in 16.16 fixed point; here it is a function
    of race time, which is the same up to per-frame truncation.

  The sine is the game's 256-step table: sin(i · 2π / 256) × 65536, truncated, interpolated
  linearly on the low byte of a 16-bit phase.
